# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to process data, to cluster data, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA.

In the above code we can see the uneven distribution of data in the Algorithm and ProofType colunms. By using dummies we are going to achieve the desired data needed to preceed in this analysis.

The above data shows the desired data needed in the Algorithm and ProofType colunms. The sumeric values are now numeric and can be used to futher analys the model.
